## About
My coworkers and I love to play [Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi), the collaborative tabletop game all about setting off fireworks. With a bunch of us working remotely I decided to build an app that allows us to continue playing our favorite game.

## The Plan

* Back End: Rails API

* Front End: React
